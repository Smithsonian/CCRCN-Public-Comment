<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><a href="#contents">Return to Top</a></p>
<p>This page serves as guidance for the types and scope of data and metadata that will be archived as part of the Network’s developing tidal soil carbon synthesis. We propose the following data structure and standardized attribute names for metadata and data in order to make datasets machineireadable and interoperable. Each subheading lists a level of metadata or data hierarchy from <em>study level</em> metadata to <em>site level</em> to <em>core level</em> to <em>depth series</em> information. Each subheading also represents separate tables which can be joined by common attributes such as study_id, site_id, and core_id. We also include accompanying sets of recommended controlled vocabulary for key categorical variables (also known as factors). Some attributes have controlled units that we wish to keep uniform across datasets. Data that we curate will follow naming conventions outlined herein. Data that we ingest from outside sources will be converted to these conventions when being ingested into the central GitHub database using custom-built R scripts.</p>
<p>At a minimum a submission should have the following for inclusion in soil carbon synthesis products: <em>study_id</em>, author information, <em>core_id</em>, latitude and longitude information associated with either a core or the site, <em>depth_min</em>, <em>depth_max</em>, <em>dry_bulk_density</em>, <em>organic_matter_fraction</em> and/or <em>carbon_fraction</em>. The more auxillary detail that you provide, the more widely your data can be used. Throughout the tables below <strong>mandatory attributes</strong> are shown in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>depth series</em> is the level at which carbon-relevant information is housed. This synthesis will not ingest core-level or site-level averages of variables like dry bulk density, fraction organic matter, or fraction carbon. These averages can be derived from the database, but are not immediately useful to our research questions unless those averages can be traced back to their original data.</p>
<p>There are many opportunities to express your data’s individuality. We refer throughout to ‘flags’ and ‘notes’. Flags refer to common methodological choices or data issues that can be coded using categorical variables. The idea behind flags is to allow users the option to query datasets based on methodology. Flags are very machine-readable but not very flexible from the standoint of a submitter. Notes are available for almost all measured attributes and take the form of free-text allowing submitters to provide context, obeservations, or concerns about methods, sites, cores, or observations. These are more flexible from the perspective of a submitter but are less machine-readable.</p>
<div id="development-process-to-date" class="section level3">
<h3>Development Process to Date</h3>
<p><a href="#contents">Return to Top</a></p>
<p>This guidance is the culminations of three efforts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://www.carboncyclescience.us/news/global-science-and-data-network-coastal-blue-carbon-workshop-completed" target="_blank">A meeting of 47 experts in Menlo Park, CA in January 2016</a>, hosted by the United States Carbon Cycle Science Program, in order to establish community priorities.</li>
<li>Experience with the initial curation of a dataset of <a href="https://doi.org/10.25572/ccrcn/10088/35684">~1,500 public soil cores</a> as part of the publication <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26948-7" target="_blank">Holmquist et al., 2018 Accuracy and Precision of Tidal Wetland Soil Carbon Mapping in the Conterminous United States.</a></li>
<li>The results of 19 collaborators submitting commentary on an <a href="https://smithsonian.github.io/CCRCN-Public-Comment/index.html" target="_blank">initial draft of these recommendations</a> put up for public comment in April and May 2018.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ongoing and Future Development</h3>
<p><a href="#contents">Return to Top</a></p>
<p>We aknowledge that this is a lot of information to process and do not want to imply &gt;100 attributes are mandatory. They are not. While we will make the entire entry template available for download (LINK PENDING), we are also in the process of designing an application which will generate a custom submission template based on your answers to a questionnaire about your dataset.</p>
<p>Submitters can feel free to add other attributes to data submissions as long as the attributes and any associated categorical variables are defined with the submission. CCRCN personnel will accept and archive related soils data within reason, but will not be able to quality control data falling outside the outlined guidance. If attributes or variablesare submitted often and there is community coordination behind their inclusion, they could be integrated into periodic updates to this guidance.</p>
<p>We anticipate that this guidance will evolve as we synthesize new datasets as part of five working groups. Part of each working group’s task will be to revisit this guidance and agree on new needed attribute names, definitions, variables, controlled vocabulary and units. Any further guidance based on the working group’s experience will be made available to the community via post-workshop reports and peer reviewed publications. Documentation on any changes to the data management plan and submission templates will be issued with version numbers. CCRCN producs will reference these documents and version numbers. We will avoid changing attribute or variable names, and will only do so if there is a compelling reason to. If in the future there ends up being more than one acceptable redundant attribute or variable name, names will be added to a database of synonyms and working synthesis products will be updated given the most current standards.</p>

<p>One dataset can be affiliated with multiple publications. This allows an original work to be cited as a primary source, as well as any secondary or synthesis papers that added value to the dataset’s archival. Submitters can simply add a bibtex style citation, such as one copied over from Google Scholar, or they can fill out all of the relevant attributes for the data release. It’s all the same to us.
