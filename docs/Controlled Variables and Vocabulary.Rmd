### Overview
Individual studies and contributors will each have their own way of naming variables, representing units, naming categorical variables, and representing notes or observations. We propose the following standardized vocabulary for data and metadata in order to make datasets machine readable and interoperable within our soil carbon synthesis products. Each sub-heading lists a level of data and metadata heirarchy from *depth series* to *core* to *site* to *study level* information. We also include accompanying sets of reccomended controlled vocabulary for key categorical variables. Some variables have controlled units that we wish to keep uniform accross datasets. Data that we curate will follow naming conventions outlined herin. Data that we ingest from outside sources will be converted to these convetions when being ingested into the central GitHub databased using custom built R scripts.
